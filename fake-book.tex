Earth surface environmental processes exhibit distinctive characteristics, encompassing both spatial and temporal dimensions, along with various attributes and predictive variables.
Furthermore, in the era of Data Science, the wealth of available data and the rapid development of analytical models have emerged as distinctive aspects in the realm of \textbf{Geospatial Data Analysis (GDA)}.
Coupled with uncertainty and complexity issues, all this contribute to making this field of research highly challenging.
The domain of GDA encompasses data exploration, manipulation, and modelling, from the acquisition phase up to the visualization and interpretation of the results.
Mapping where events are located and how they relate to each other provides a better understanding of the process being studied.
Finally, as an increasing volume of geo-environmental data becomes more and more accessible, the demand for experts in this domain is growing rapidly, both in public research institutions as well as in private companies.

Defined for the first time by Naur as \emph{``The science of dealing with data''}, the term \textbf{Data Science} evolved over time around the original concept of \emph{``\ldots converting data into information and knowledge''} (IASC, 1977).
In the disciplines like Environmental and Earth Sciences, Physical Geography, Humanities and Social Sciences, the use of Data Science procedures is emerging only recently, proving to be extremely efficient to deal with the complexity of the investigated process and the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources.
This leads to a cultural shift, moving scientists away from individual working within their own research domain.
Indeed, disciplinary boundaries are more and more permeable, pushing scientists to be more open to collaborate among them and with decision makers on the investigation and understanding of real-world problems.
Modern earth and environmental scientists need to interact with other disciplines, apparently far from their domain.
This openness is increasingly important as society struggles to respond to the implication of anthropogenic pressures on different issues, such as natural hazards and climate change, or the harmful impacts of human activities on biodiversity, water and air quality, human health.

\textbf{The target audience of this eBook} are master and graduate (PhD) students in Earth/Environmental Sciences, Biology and Spatial Ecology, Physical Geography, and equivalent disciplines.
We strive to empower students by guiding them through both theoretical knowledge and hands-on practical applications, enabling them to cultivate effective problem-solving skills.
The primary focus here delves into applying Data Science methodologies to understand and analyze Earth's surface environmental processes.
The scientific approaches related to this emerging discipline, ranging from statistics, mathematics, geomatics and computer science, are often hard to be acquired.
While maintaining a strong emphasis on rigorous mathematical and statistical formalism in the methods presented, this eBook primarily accentuates their practical applications within the realm of Geosciences

The book is addressed to intermediate to advanced R users with some experience on geospatial data and a great interest in geocomputing.
If you have some very basic knowledge in these fields, we encourage you to explore links provided in each chapter, which redirect you to further useful documentation.

\textbf{This eBook seeks to provide the audience with}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A good understanding of main practical concepts and applied aspects in GDA;
\item
  Advanced tools designed to proficiently navigate various techniques for analysing spatial datasets in geosciences.
\end{itemize}

Specifically, the methodologies outlined will equip readers with expertise in various algorithms tailored for analyzing complex geo-environmental datasets.
This knowledge will empower them to extract valuable insights and translate them into actionable decisions.

Explored algorithms include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics} for exploratory data analyses and visualization of geographical variations in the statistical data distribution;
\item
  \emph{Ripley's K-function, Kernel Density Estimator, DBSCAN} for cluster detection and mapping;
\item
  \emph{Self-Organizing Maps} as an example of unsupervised machine learning approach to data clustering and visualization;
\item
  \emph{Random Forest} as an example of a supervised machine learning algorithm, applied here for classification.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Author Information}\label{author-information}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Author Information}

Marj Tonini is a spatial data scientist with a strong interest on geospatial modelling for risk assessment, mainly related to wildfires and landslides. She gained her PhD in 2002 at Sant'Anna School of advanced studies (Pisa, Italy), defending a thesis on agro-environmental modelling. She started working at the University of Lausanne in 2004, as post-doc and, in 2008, she was appointed senior research manager at the Institute of Earth Surface Dynamics (current position).

Her research focuses on the development of innovative approaches allowing to enable efficient learning from complex environmental datasets. She seeks to set up a methodological framework to understand the spatio-temporal dynamic of environmental processes and to assess the influence of predictor variables. Her current research targets are on land use/land cover change analyses and on the elaboration of predictive scenario and susceptibility / risk assessment for natural hazard.

Haokun Liu is a Ph.D.~student at the Group of Cities and dynamics of networks (CITADYNE Group), University of Lausanne. Meanwhile, he is also a student assistant at Swiss Geocomputing Center (SGC). Benefiting from the strict and effective training in China and Switzerland, his research interests and experience include, but are not limited to: 1) Urban analytics, 2) Health geography, 3) Spatial data science. With the goal of bridging the gap between theories and practical applications, he am focusing on the intersections among urban health, complex perspective, activity space, and the Spatial-social-semantic framework.

\section{R Language}\label{r-language}}

R is a complete programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphical representation.
As part of the GNU Project (free software, mass collaboration project), the source code is free available.
Its functionalities can be expanded by importing packages.
For more details on R see \url{https://www.r-project.org/}.

\hypertarget{r-packages}{%
\subsection{R Packages}\label{r-packages}}

A package is a file generally composed of R scripts (e.g., functions).
On all operation systems the function ``install.packages()'' can be used to download and install a package automatically.
Otherwise, a package already installed in R can be loaded in a session by using the command \textcolor{red}{library(package_name)}.
In R, the directories where the packages are stored are called ``libraries''. The terms ``package'' and ``library'' are sometimes used synonymously.
For example, to check the list of the installed packeges, the function \textcolor{red}{library()} can be used.
When you open an \textbf{R Markdown} document (.Rmd) the program propose you automatically to install the libraries listed there.

\hypertarget{some-tips}{%
\subsection{Some tips}\label{some-tips}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R is case sensitive!
\item
  Previously used command can be recalled in the console by using the \emph{up arrow} on the keyboard.
\item
  The working directory by default is ``\emph{C:/user/\ldots/Documents}''.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    It can be found using the command \textcolor{red}{getwd()}
  \item
    It can be changed using the command line \textcolor{red}{setwd("C:/Your/own/path")}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In \textbf{R Markdown}: the working directory when evaluating R code chunks is the directory of the input document by default.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    To access to a specific file in a sub-folder use ``. /subfolder/file.ext''
  \item
    To access to a specific file in a up-folder use ``. . /upfolder/file.ext''
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{r-markdown}{%
\section{R Markdown}\label{r-markdown}}

This is an R Markdown document :-)

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
It is a simple and easy to use \textbf{plain text language} allowing to combine R code, results from data analysis (including plots and tables), and comments into a single nicely formatted and \emph{reproducible} document (like a report, publication, thesis chapter or web pages).

Code lines are organized into code blocks, seeking to solve specified tasks, and referred to as \textbf{``code chunk''}.
For more details on using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.

All what you have to do during the computing labs is to read each explanatory paragraph before running each individual R code chunk, one by one, and to interpret the results.
Finally, to create a personal document (usually a PDF) from rmarkdown, you need to \textbf{Knit} the document.
Knitting a document simply means taking all the text and code and creating a nicely formatted document.

\hypertarget{variables}{%
\subsection{Variables}\label{variables}}

Variables are used to store values in a computer program.
Values can be numbers (real and complex), words (string), matrices, and even tables.

The fundamental or atomic data in R Programming can be:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{integer}: number without decimals
\item
  \textbf{numeric}: number with decimals (\emph{float} or \emph{double} depending on the precision)
\item
  \textbf{character}: string, label
\item
  \textbf{factors}: a label with a limited number of categories
\item
  \textbf{logical}: true/false
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{data-structure-in-r}{%
\subsection{Data structure in R}\label{data-structure-in-r}}

R's base data structures can be organised by their dimensionality (1d, 2d, or nd) and whether they are homogeneous (all contents must be of the same type) or heterogeneous (the contents can be of different types).

This gives rise to the four data structures most often used in data analysis:

\hypertarget{data-frame}{%
\subsection{Data Frame}\label{data-frame}}

A \textbf{data frame} allows to collect data of different type.
All elements must have the same length.

A \textbf{list} is a more flexible structure since it can contain variables of different types and lengths.
Nevertheless, the preferred structure for statistical analyses and computation is the data frame.

It is a good practice to explore the data frame before performing further computation on the data.
This can be simply accomplished by using the commands \textcolor{red}{str} to explore the structure of the data and \textcolor{red}{summary} to display the summary statistics and quickly summarize the data.
For numerical vectors the command \textcolor{red}{hist()} can be used to plot the basic histogram of the given values.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

In fire management, it is crucial to investigate where fires occurred more frequently and to distinguish between \textbf{small} and \textbf{large fires}.
This is key information to understand the ignition factors and planning strategies to reduce forest fires, control and manage ignition sources, and identify areas at risk.

Despite the availability of forest fires spatio-temporal inventories, it is not evident to extract information about their pattern distribution simply by looking at the original arrangement of the mapped burnt areas.
To this end, \textbf{Geographically Weighed Summary Statistics (GWSS)} can be computed, under the assumption that burned areas generally follow a geographic trend.

We compute here the GW local means, the GW local standard deviation and the GW localized skewness of burned areas in continental Portugal, registered in the period 1990-2013.
This application is inspired by the work of \citep{tonini_evolution_2017}

\hypertarget{the-overall-methodology}{%
\section{The overall methodology}\label{the-overall-methodology}}

\textbf{Summary statistics} include a number of measures that can be used to summarize a set of observations, the most important of which are measures of \emph{central tendency} (arithmetic mean, median and mode) and measures of \emph{dispersion around the mean} (variance and standard deviation).
In addition, measures of \emph{skewness} and \emph{kurtosis} are descriptors of the shape of the probability distribution function, the former indicating the asymmetry and the latter the peakedness/tailedness of the curve.

In the case of \textbf{spatial data}, these global statistical descriptors may vary from one region to another, as their values may be affected by local environmental and socio-economic factors.
In this case, an appropriately localized calibration can provide a better description of the observed values.
One way to achieve this goal is to \emph{weight} the above statistical measures for a given quantitative variable based on their geographical location.

We introduce here the method proposed by \citep{brunsdon_geographically_2002} and implemented in the \textbf{function GWSS} presented in the \textcolor{red} {R package GWmodel} \citep{lu_gwmodel_2014, brunsdon_rpubs_2019}.
The evaluation of geographically weighted summary statistics is obtained by computing a summary for a small area around each geolocalized punctual observation, by using the \emph{kernel density estimation} technique (KDE) \citep{brunsdon_estimating_1995}.
KDE is estimated at each point, taking into account the influence of the points falling within an area, with increasing weight towards the center, corresponding to the point location.
A surface summary statistic is thus obtained.

\hypertarget{forest-fires-dataset}{%
\section{Forest fires dataset}\label{forest-fires-dataset}}

Forest fires inventories indicating the location, the starting date and other related variables, such as the cause of ignition and the size of the area burned, are broadly available with a different degree of accuracy in different countries.

In the present study, we consider the \textbf{Portuguese National Mapping Burnt Areas (NMBA 2016)}, freely available from the website of the Institute for the Conservation of Nature and Forests (ICNF).
This is a long spatio-temporal dataset (from 1975) resulting from the processing of satellite images acquired once a year at the end of the summer season.
Row data consist of records of observed fire scars.
The burned areas were estimated by using image classification techniques, then compared with ground data to resolve the discrepancies.
Polygons have been converted into point shapefile, where each point represent the centroid of the burned areas, while the size of the burned areas and the starting date of the fires events are given as attributes.
In this work, for consistency reasons, we consider only fires occurred between 1990 and 2013 and with a burned area above 5 hectares.

\hypertarget{import-the-portuguese-forest-fire-dataset}{%
\subsection{Import the Portuguese forest fire dataset}\label{import-the-portuguese-forest-fire-dataset}}

In this section you will load the geodata representing the dataset of forest fires occurred in the continental Portuguese area in the period 1990-2013.
You will also load the boundaries of the study area.
You will start by exploring the datasets using mainly visual tools (plotting and histogram).

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You can explore the dataset by using different tools for \textbf{exploratory data analyses}.
You will start by visualizing the databases.
In the GIS environment, this correspond to the attribute table of a vector punctual feature.

Than you can \textbf{plot the histogram} of events distribution based on the variable \emph{``Area\_ha''} (the size in hectares of the burned area).
Since this is a power low distribution, for a better understanding it's recommended to transform the data using a logarithmic scale.
Using Log10 you can easily evaluate the frequency distribution of the burned areas.

\hypertarget{forest-fires-spatial-distribution}{%
\subsection{Forest fires spatial distribution}\label{forest-fires-spatial-distribution}}

For a better understanding of the phenomenon, you can group the events according to the size of the burned area.
Based on the frequency distribution of the burned areas, the following three classes can be defined:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Small fires}: less than 15 ha
\item
  \textbf{Medium fires}: between 15 ha and 100 ha
\item
  \textbf{Large fires}: bigger than 100 ha
\end{itemize}

Plotting the forest fires events using different colors, based on the size of the burned areas, can simplify the understanding of their \textbf{pattern distribution}, knowing that fires of different size have normally different drivers.

\hypertarget{compute-the-geographically-whited-statistics}{%
\section{Compute the geographically whited statistics}\label{compute-the-geographically-whited-statistics}}

From the exploratory data analysis performed above, it seems that a simple plotting of the forest fires events based on their spatial distribution, even if classified based on their size, can not really help to understand their behaviors.
This is because we face to a huge number of events and the variable that we are using to characterize them (i.e., the size of the burned area) is very heterogeneous.
To this aim, we can compute basic and robust \textbf{GWSS} and plot the data accordingly.

GWSS includes \emph{geographically weighted means}, \emph{standard deviations} and the \emph{skweness}.
As you can see from the R Documentation (command: \textcolor{red}{help(gwss)}, same data manipulations are necessary to transform the forest fires dataset in a compatible data frame format.

\textbf{GWSS parameters}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  We summarize the data based on the size of the burned area (\emph{vars}).
\item
  We use here an adaptive kernel where the bandwidth (\emph{bw}) corresponds to the number (100 in this case) of nearest neighbors (i.e.~adaptive distance).
\item
  We keep the default values for the other parameters.

\hypertarget{gwss-maps}{%
\subsection{GWSS maps}\label{gwss-maps}}

To produce a map of the local geographically weighted summary statistic of your choice, firstly we need to enter a small R function definition.
This is just a short R program to draw a map: you can think of it as a command that tells R how to draw a map (see \protect\hyperlink{geographically-weighted-summary-statistics}{Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics} (\url{https://rpubs.com/chrisbrunsdon/99667}) for more details).
The advantage of defining a function is that the entire map can now be drawn using a single command for each variable, rather than having to repeat those steps each time.
To define the intervals for the classification we used Jenks natural breaks classification method (textcolor\{red\}\{style=``fisher''\}).

Finally the function is called by entering:

\section{Conclusions and further analyses}\label{conclusions-and-further-analyses}}

This practical computer lab allowed you to familiarize with GWSS, by the proposed application about geographically weighted summary statistics.
This method allowed us to explore how the average burned area vary locally through Continental Portugal in the period 1990-2013.

The global Geographically Weighted (GW) means informs you about the local average value of the burned area, based of the neighboring events occurred in a given period.
Similarly, you may compute a GW standard deviation to see the extent to which the size of the burned area spread around this mean.
Finally you can compute the GW skewness to measure the symmetry of distribution: a positively skewed distribution means that there is a higher number of data points having low values, with mean value lower that the median; and the contrary for a negatively skewed distribution.

To be sure that everything is perfectly clear for you, we propose you to \textbf{answer the following questions} and to discuss your answers with the other participants to the course or directly with the teacher.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  What is the pattern distribution of the GW-means for burned area in Portugal during the investigated periods?
\item
  Does the GW-standard deviation follows the same pattern?
  How can you interpret the two pattern in terms of burned area and their characterization?
\item
  GW-skewness has positive values everywhere: what does it means?
  What do these values suggest to be the distribution of the burned areas, in terms of their size, around the local means?
\item
  Which can be other applications of GWSS for geo-environmental data?
  In other words, can you imagine other geo-environmental dataset that can be analysed using GWSS?
\item
  You can finally play with the code and try to run it using a different numbers of nearest neighbors (bw=x) and comparing the results.

  \textbf{NB:} You have to rename the original pdf to avoid overwriting it.
  In addition, if a pdf with the same name saved in the same destination folder is open, you will receive an error message, so close it before Knitting.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

The configuration of forest fires across space and time presents a complex pattern which significantly affects the forest environment and adjacent human developments.
Statistical techniques designed for spatio-temporal random points can be utilized to identify a structure, recognize hot-spots and vulnerable areas, and address policy makers to prevention and forecasting measures.

In this practical computer lab we consider the same case study as in the ``Geographically Weighted Summary Statistics'' lab.
The main objective is to reveal if space and time act independently or whether neighboring events are also closer in time, interacting to generate spatio-temporal clusters.
The attribute that we will consider to achieve this goal is the starting date of fires events.
To account for the different geographical distribution of fires in Portugal, evets occurred in the Norther and Southern area will be modeled separately.

For more details about the input dataset, please refer to the GWSS lab documentation.

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

To detect spatio-temporal clusters of forest fires, we will use the following statistical methods:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The \textbf{Ripley's K- function}, to test the space--time interaction and the spatial attraction/in dependency between fires of different size.
\item
  The \textbf{kernel density estimator}, allowing elaborating smoothed density surfaces representing fires over-densities.
\end{enumerate}

We provide below a short description for both these methods.
More details can be found in \citet{tonini_evolution_2017}.

\hypertarget{ripleys-k-function}{%
\subsection{Ripley's K-function}\label{ripleys-k-function}}

The Ripley's K-function allows inferring about the spatial randomness of mapped punctual events.
It is largely applied in environmental studies to analyse the pattern distribution of a spatial point process.
The original spatial univariate K-function \(K(s)\) is defined as the ratio between the expected number \(E\) of point events falling at a certain distance \(r\) from an arbitrary event and the intensity \(\lambda\) of the spatial point process, this last corresponding to the average number of points per unit area.

Under complete spatial randomness, which assumes the independence among the events, \(K(s)\) is equal to the area of the circle around the target event for each distance's value.
It follows that events are spatially clustered within the range of distances at which \(K(s)\) assumes vales higher than this area, while they are spatially dispersed for lower values.
The temporal K-function \(K(t)\) is defined in the same way as for the spatial case, with the time-based intensity and the time length replacing the spatial parameters.

The \textbf{spatio-temporal K-function,} \(K(s,t)\) can be considered as a bivariate function where space and time represent the two variables of the equation.
It is defined as the number of further events occurring within a distance \(r\) and time \(t\) from an arbitrary event.

\hypertarget{spatio-temporal-interaction}{%
\subsubsection{Spatio-temporal interaction}\label{spatio-temporal-interaction}}

If there is no space--time interaction, \(K(s,t)\) is equal to the product of the purely spatial and purely temporal K-function.
Inversely, if space and time interact generating clusters, the difference between these two values is positive {[}\(D(s,t)=K(s,t)-K(s)*K(t)\){]}.

Thus, we can use the perspective 3D-plot of the function \(D(s,t)\) to obtain a first diagnostic of space--time clustering: positive values indicate an interaction between these two variables at a well-detectable spatio-temporal scale.

\hypertarget{kernel-density-estimator-1}{%
\subsection{Kernel density estimator}\label{kernel-density-estimator-1}}

The Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is a non-parametric descriptor tool widely applied in GIS-science to elaborate smoothed density surfaces from spatial variables.
A kernel function \(K\) allows weighing up the contribution of each event, based on the relative distance of neighbouring to the target.
The parameter \(h\), called bandwidth, controls the smoothness of the estimated kernel density.
Finally, the kernel density function \(f_h(x)\) is estimated by summing all the kernel functions \(K\) computed at each point location \(x\) and dividing the result by the total number of events (\(n\)): \[f_h(x) = \frac{1}{nh}\sum_{i=j}^{n}K(\frac{x-x_i}{h})\]

The time extension of the kernel density estimator (\citet{nakaya_visualising_2010}) allows to compute the \textbf{three-dimensional kernel density estimator} which includes the spatio-temporal dimensions.

In the present case study we apply a quadratic weighting kernel function, which is an approximation to the Gaussian kernel.
Regarding the bandwidth's value, we prose to consider the results of the spatio-temporal K-function as an indicator.
Indeed, the distance values showing a maximum cluster behavior over the displayed perspective \(D(s,t)\) plot can be attributed to the \(h\)-value, minimizing the problem of under- or over-smoothing due to an arbitrary choice of the bandwidth.

Remember that fires of different size can have been induced by different drivers.
Thus, in the following, we will investigate all the global cluster behavior of forest fires in Portugal considering the three subset separately.
As you have seen in the lab GWSS, based on the frequency distribution of the burned areas, the following three classes can be defined:

* Small fires: less than 15 ha

* Medium fires: between 15 ha and 100 ha

* Large fires: bigger than 100 ha

\item
  \emph{times}: a vector of times, defined by the starting date of ignition.

Finally you will plot the perspective 3D-plot of \(D(s,t)\) to evaluate the space--time clustering behavior of forest fires in the present case study.
The multifaceted shape of this function, along the spatial and the temporal dimension, can help to identify peaks of clustering.
Finally, the corresponding values can be attributed to the bandwidth of the kernel density estimators allowing to elaborate smoothed density maps in the last step of this lab.

these two values are attributed to the bandwidth of the kernel density estimators allowing to elaborate smoothed density maps.

\section{Conclusions and further analyses}\label{conclusions-and-further-analyses-1}}

This practical computer lab allowed you to familiarize with the assement of the global cluster behavior of hazardous events, achieved by using the Ripley's k-function.
In addition, we learned how smoothed density maps can be elaborated from punctual events, namely using the kernel density estimator.
Both spatial and the temporal dimension have been considered in this case.

This method allowed us to explore density distribution of forest fires events through Continental Portugal in the period 1990-2013.
In the northern half of the country, hot spots are present almost on each investigated years, with a higher concentration in the northern areas.

To be sure that everything is perfectly clear for you, we propose you to do this lab again, by using this time another subset chosen among the forest fires in the Southern area, the small, medium or the large forest fires dataset.

For whatever dataset you are going to use, try to answer to the following questions.
The reading of the paper \citet{tonini_evolution_2017}, which inspired this lab, can help you in in this task.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  At which spatial and temporal distance you can observe a peak of clustering?
\item

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been one of the most successful methods for 3D data collection in the last few years.
Sequential acquisition can be used to detect and quantify surface changes.
The three main challenges arising from TLS data collection are: 1) the large number of points acquired is computationally intense and datasets have to be filtered depending on the aim of the investigation; 2) data collection methods suffer from perspective effects, which can lead to either zones of occlusion (shadow effect) or spatially-variable point densities; 3) 3D point clouds are normally interpolated to digital elevation models either as regular grids or triangulated irregular networks.
Thus, for change detection proposes (i.e.~determination of topographic change, including erosion and deposition), it is appropriate to develop methods based upon the direct analysis of the point clouds using semi-automatic approaches allowing to detect and extract individual features.

In this practical computer lab we introduce a semi-automated method developed for isolating and identifying features of topographic change (i.e., apparent changes caused by surface displacements and indicating erosion or deposition) directly from point cloud data using a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN).
This methodology was developed by \citet{micheletti_geomorphological_2017} for a very active rock glacier front located in the Swiss Alps: the Tsarmine rock glacier.

\textbf{Stepwise analysis:}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Point clouds were generated using a TLS on a number of dates.
\item
  Point clouds were co-registered using stable zones within the surveyed area.
\item
  Using a threshold value, only the points where there may have been some topographical change were selected.
\item
  The final dataset was treated with DBSCAN, aiming at grouping cluster-points into single features and filtering out noise points, found in low-density regions.
\end{enumerate}

The present lab deals with steps 2 and 3: feature detection using DBSCAN.
The detected features are finally labeled as clusters and visualized in a 3D map.

Material loss or gain can be analysed in a GIS environment according to the elevation assignment of the change and the volume of change computed for each cluster by a triangulation process (not performed in this lab).

\hypertarget{dbscan-3-d-density-based-clustering-algorithm}{%
\subsection{DBSCAN: 3-D density based clustering algorithm}\label{dbscan-3-d-density-based-clustering-algorithm}}

DBSCAN allows identification of spatial clusters of arbitrary shape on the base of the local density of points.
Points that are close together are grouped into the same cluster, while isolated points are labelled as noise.

Two parameters are required to perform this classification: the minimum number of points necessary to form a cluster (\(MinPts\)), and the neighborhood size epsilon (\(eps\)).
The algorithm explores each point in the dataset, counting the number of the neighboring points falling within a circle (for the 2D model) or a sphere (for the 3D model) of radius equal to \(eps\) (\autoref{dbscan}a).
If this number is equal to or greater than \(MinPts\), points are labelled as belonging to the same cluster (\autoref{dbscan}b).
If this number is lower than \(MinPts\), points are classified as noise.
The central point of each cluster is called core-point.
Since some points can be density-reachable by more than one core-point, they can belong to more than one cluster.
In this case clusters are blended together to form a unique cluster feature of arbitrary shape (\autoref{dbscan}c).

\hypertarget{field-campaign}{%
\subsection{Field campaign}\label{field-campaign}}

An ultra-long range LiDAR RIEGL VZ-6000 scanner was employed to acquire sequential 3D datasets of the rock glacier front.
TLS scans were performed on different dates over two consecutive summers: a first survey was carried out on the 23th of September 2014, and the last one on the 22th of September 2015.

The instrument is equipped with on-board inclination sensors: this allows to use the inclination data to obtain (locally) georeferenced datasets where the Z dimension represents the elevation above the X-Y plane.
After co-registration, a mask was used to restrict point clouds to the area of interest: the front of the rock glacier and the corridor below.

DBSCAN requires as input a 3-dimensional dataset, which in our case consists on the points clouds (X,Y,Z) plus the displacement distance.
For the two co-registered datasets (2014 and 2015), we set the first as the target and the more recent as the reference.
For each point in the target cloud the corresponding nearest point in the reference cloud was identified and the distance between them evaluated using the software Cloud Compare.
Co-registration errors, estimated as noise and not real material loss/gain signals, has to be removed from the analysis.
Here, we noted from field observations that the size of displaced boulders is typically \textgreater{} 0.30 m and we use this as a change criteria to remove the noise.

The two parameters \(eps\) and \(MinPts\) greatly affect the output cluster detection leading the the identification of a large number of small clusters (for small values) or a small number of large features of arbitrary shape (for large values).
Once fixed the \(MinPts\) parameter, a suitable value for the \(eps\) neighborhood size can be estimated using a \textbf{k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) distance graph}, imposing k as equal to \(MinPts\) and plotting the distance to the nearest neighbors.
The optimal \(eps\)-value should coincide with the stronger curvature of the curve.

In the following, the minimum number of points allowing to form a cluster is fixed first, and then the plot of the k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) distance is used to find a suitable value for the \(eps\) neighborhood size.
We can use this function to find the NN-distance (for a given k-value) corresponding to the stronger curvature.
This values gives the best neighborhood size \(eps\)

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-3}}

The increasing availability of multivariate datatets stimulates researches to develop new techniques that differ from those utilized in earlier scientific paradigms.
In the field of social and economic science, geo-demographic segmentation defines a technique used to classify a population based on input data describing administrative units and people living there \citep[see][]{spielman_social_2008}.
Small areas can thus be classified into discrete categories using demographic input data, by means of data reduction techniques (such as the \emph{Principal component analysis}).
The main limitation of these approaches is the problem of communicating the multidimensional complexity characterizing the different output classes.

\textbf{Machine learning} techniques can help in this context, as they are designed to extract useful formation and insight from the interaction of the variables describing the complex structure of a given phenomenon.
In the present computing lab we introduce an unsupervised learning procedure based on \emph{Self-Organizing Map (SOM)} \citep[see][]{kohonen_self-organized_1982}, allowing detecting clusters and characterizing the pattern of population dynamic in Switzerland in the recent period.
This lab is inspired by the work of \citet{marj_tonini_unsupervised_2023}.

Switzerland has the highest life expectancy in the world.
It counts about 8,5 million inhabitants (official census data 2020), twice as much as at the beginning of the 20th century, mainly because of the high level of immigration.
The number of foreigners that currently reside in the country corresponds to about one quarter of the total population.
Most of the population (85\%) lives in cities.
Population aging increased over the course of the 20th century, with one in five person of retirement age today.
In the present study, we developed a machine learning based approach to understand and describe the population patterns in different geographic areas.

\hypertarget{som}{%
\subsection{SOM}\label{som}}

We use \textbf{SOM}, an \emph{unsupervised competitive learning neural network} allowing representing a high-dimensional feature space (defined by the multivariate input dataset), as two-dimensional discretized pattern (the SOM grid of neurons).
In SOM the proximity of the units in the output grid reflects the similarity of the corresponding input observations, which guarantees the preservation of the topological structure of the input data.

Compared to other approaches, SOM is very efficient for data visualization.
Indeed it provides additional outputs such as the heatmaps, representing the distribution of each input feature across the SOM grid, extremely useful to visually explore the relationship between the input variables.

\subsection{Data transformation}\label{data-transformation}}

Data transformation seeks the make the variables range comparable.
This process ensure the data entries to look similar across all fields and records, making information easier to find, group and analyze.

With \textbf{Min-Max Scaling}, the data values are scaled in a range between 0 and 1.
As a consequence, the effect of outliers suppresses to a certain extent.
Moreover, it helps us to have a smaller value of the standard deviation of the data scaled.

\hypertarget{compute-som}{%
\subsection{Compute SOM}\label{compute-som}}

The main idea with \textbf{SOM} is to map the input high-dimensional feature space in a lower-dimensional output space organized on a grid made up of regular units (i.e.~the neurons).
At the end of the process, each observation from the input space (\(X_{k,i}\)) will be associated (i.e., mapped) to a unit in the SOM grid.
Depending on the size of the grid, one unit can include several input observations.

The first step consists in defining the size and geometry of the SOM grid.
In this case we define a rectangular grid of 18 by 13 units, allowing to allocate, on average, about 15 input-items per units, and whose geometry reproduces the shape of the study area.
(\textbf{NB}: several parameters and configurations of the SOM grid can be implemented and compared, seeking to minimize the \emph{Quantization Error, QE})

Finally, you can run the SOM model.
Note that \emph{rlen} indicates the number of times the complete data set will be presented to the network, while for the other parameters we will keep the default values.

The overall computation include the following steps:

\textbf{1) The data frame has to be transformed to a matrix}

\textbf{4) SOM-model evaluation}

Finally, you can optimize the size of the grid by inspecting several quality measure and changing the parameters accordingly.
In particular we will explore the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Changes}: shows the mean distance to the closest codebook vector during the training.
\item
  \emph{Quantization error}: average squared distance between the data points and the map's codebook to which they are mapped.
  Lower is better.
\item
  \emph{Percentage of explained variance}: similar to other clustering methods, the share of total variance that is explained by the clustering (equal to 1 minus the ratio of quantization error to total variance).
  Higher is better.

Hierarchical clustering can finally be performed to isolate groups of input vectors characterized by a similar distribution of the input variables.

You can import the final table with the values of the population census variable in a GIS and join the values to the administrative limits at municipality levels in Switzerland.
This allows you to elaborate a map as in \autoref{Clusters_7}.

\textbf{NB}. You need only two columns: the code identifying each municipality (``BFS\_nummer'') and the cluster number (hc).
Open the table including the resulting clusters with a dedicated program (like Excel) to reorganize the header, as a new column for unique identifier has been created automatically (you can name it ``ID''), and headers has to be shifted of one place on the right.

Box-plot is a standardized way to display a dataset based on the five-number summary statistics: the minimum, the maximum, the sample median, and the first and third quartiles (i.e., the median of the lower half (25\%) and the median of the upper half (75\%) of the dataset).

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

Results of the present study reveal the main patterns of the population in Switzerland based on the surveyed land-use, socio-economic, and demographic indicators.
To characterize the final main clusters, the distribution of each variable within them have been assessed by using \textbf{box plots}.
We could thus identify main clusters including the most developed and active cities with higher income, the peri-urban areas mostly devoted to the agricultural activity, or the areas with higher levels of migration.

\textbf{SOM heatmaps} allow to display the pattern distribution of each input variable over the SOM-grid and how values change in space.
Visualized side by side, heatmaps show a picture of the different areas and their characteristics.
In this way it is possible to explore the level of complementarity that links one or more variables among them.

In conclusion, in the present study we proposed a performant data-driven approach based on unsupervised learning allowing to extract useful information from a huge volume of multivariate population census data.
This approach led to represent and interpret the main patterns characterizing the dynamic of population in Switzerland in the recent period.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-4}}

In this application, we explore the capabilities of a stochastic approach based on a machine learning (ML) algorithm to elaborate landslides susceptibility mapping in Canton Vaud, Switzerland.
Generally speaking, ML includes a class of algorithms for the analysis, modelling, and visualization of environmental data and it performs particularly well to model environmental hazards, which naturally have a complex and non-linear behavior.
Here we use Random Forest, an ensemble ML algorithm based on decision trees.

The research framework that inspired this computational lab refers to a pioneering study in susceptibility mapping for wildfire eventy by \citet{tonini_machine_2020} and further developed for the assessment of variable importance by \citet{trucchia_machine-learning_2022}.

\hypertarget{the-main-objective}{%
\subsection{The main objective}\label{the-main-objective}}

Landslides are one of the major hazard occurring around the world.
In Switzerland, landslides cause damages to infrastructures and sometimes threaten human lives.
Shallow landslides are triggered by intense rainfalls.
Such slope movements are generally very rapid and hardly predictable.
Different quantitative approaches have been developed to assess the most susceptible areas.

This project applies a data-driven methodology based on Random Forest (RF) (\citet{breiman_random_2001}) to elaborate the landslides susceptibility map of canton of Vaud, in Switzerland.
RF is applied to a set of independent variables (i.e., the predictors) and dependent variables (the inventoried landslides and an equal number of locations for absences).
The overall methodology is described in the following graphic (\autoref{Methodology}).

\section{Import the data}\label{import-the-data-1}}

Import the \textbf{landslides punctual dataset} presences and pseudo-absences (LS\_pa) and \emph{predictors} (in raster format).
This help the exploratory data analyses steps and to understand the input data structure.

\hypertarget{landslides-dataset}{%
\subsection{Landslides dataset}\label{landslides-dataset}}

The \textbf{landslide inventory} has been provided by the environmental office of the canton of Vaud.
Only \emph{shallow landslides} are used for susceptibility modelling.
One pixel per landslide-area (namely the one located at the highest elevation) has been extracted.
Since the landslide scarp is located in the upper part of the polygon, it makes sense to consider the highest pixel to characterize each single event.

Our model includes the implementation of the landslide \textbf{pseudo-absences}, which are the areas where the hazardous events did not took place (i.e.~landslide location is known and the mapped footprint areas are available, but the non-landslide areas have to be defined).
Indeed, to assure a good generalization of the model and to avoid the overestimation of the absence, pseudo-absences need to be generated in all the cases where they are not explicitly expressed.
In this case study, an equal number of point as for presences has been randomly generated in the study area, except within landslides polygons, lakes and glaciers (that is what is called ``validity domain'', where events could potentially occur).

\hypertarget{predictor-variables}{%
\subsection{Predictor variables}\label{predictor-variables}}

Selecting predictor variables is a key stage on susceptibility ans risk modelling when using a data-driven approach.
There is no consensus about the number of variables and which variables should be used for landslides assesment.
In the present exercise we will use the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{DEM (digital elevation model)}: provided by the Swiss Federal Office of Topography.
  The elevation is not a direct conditioning factor for landslide; however, it can reflect differences in vegetation characteristics and soil.
\item
  \textbf{Slope}: is one of the most explicating factor in landslide susceptibility modelling.
  It is computing as:
\end{itemize}

\[Slope = arctan(\sqrt{(dz/dx)^2 + (dz/dy)^2)} * (\pi/2)\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Curvature}: curvature is widely used in landslide susceptibility modelling.
  It allows assessing the water flow acceleration and sediment transport process (\emph{profile curvature}) and the water flow propensity to converge and diverge (\emph{plan curvature}).
  They were derived from DEM using the curvature tool in ArcGIS.
\item
  \textbf{TWI (topographical water index)}: topography plays a key role in the spatial distribution of soil hydrological conditions.
  Defining \(\alpha\) as the upslope contributing area describing the propensity of a cell to receive water, and \(\beta\) as the slope angle, TWI (compute by the formula below), reflects the propensity of a cell to evacuate water:
\end{itemize}

\[TWI=ln(\alpha/tan(\beta))\]

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Distance to roads}: roads build in mountainous areas often cut the slope, weakening the cohesion of the soil.
  Moreover, roads surfaces are highly impermeable.
  This raster has been elaborated using the euclidean distance tool in ArcGIS, from the swissTLMRegio map where roads are represented by lines.
\item
  \textbf{Land Cover}: developed by the Swiss administration and based on aerial photographs and control points.
  It includes 27 categories distributed in the following 6 domains: human modified surfaces, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs vegetation, tree vegetation, surfaces without vegetation, water surfaces (glaciers included).
\item
  \textbf{Geology}: The use of the lithology increase the performance of the susceptibility landslide models.
  We use here the map elaborated by the Canton Vaud, defining the geotypes and reclassified in 10 classes in order to differentiate sedimentary rocks.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-use-of-categorical-variables-in-machine-learning}{%
\subsubsection{The use of categorical variables in Machine Learning}\label{the-use-of-categorical-variables-in-machine-learning}}

The majority of ML algorithms (e.g., support vector machines, artificial neural network, deep learning) makes predictions on the base of the proximity between the values of the predictors, computed in terms of euclidean distance.
This means that these algorithms can not handle directly categorical values (i.e., qualitative descriptors).
Thus, in most of the cases, categorical variables need to be transformed into a numerical format.
One of the advantage of using Random Forest (as implemented in R) is that it can handle directly categorical variables, since the algorithm operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and the best split is chosen just by counting the proportion of each class observation.

To understand the characteristics of the categorical variables, you can plot the tow rasters \textbf{Land Cover} and \textbf{Geology} by using their original classes.
To visualize the data, you can use R as a GIS, but you need to perform few data manipulations.

Computationally, a subset of the training dataset is generated by bootstrapping (i.e.~random sampling with replacement).
For each subset a decision tree is grown and, at each split, the algorithm randomly selects a number of variables (\emph{mtry}) and it computes the Gini index to identify the best one.
The process stops when each node contains less than a fixed number of data points.
The fundamental hyperparameters that needs to be defined in RF are \emph{mtry} and the total number of trees (\emph{ntrees}).

The prediction error on the training dataset is finally assessed by evaluating predictions on those observations that were not used in the subset, defined as ``out-of-bag'' (\textbf{OOB}).
This values is used the optimize the values of the hyperparameters, by a trial and error process (that is, trying to minimize the OOB estimate of error rate).

\subsection{Model evaluation}\label{model-evaluation}}

The prediction capability of the implemented RF model can be evaluated by predicting the results over previously unseen data, that is the testing dataset.
The \emph{Area Under the ``Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)'' Curve} (\textbf{AUC}) represents the evaluation score used here as indicator of the goodness of the model in classifying areas more susceptible to landslides.
ROC curve is a graphical technique based on the plot of the percentage of correct classification (the true positives rate) against the false positives rate (occurring when an outcome is incorrectly predicted as belonging to the class ``1'' when it actually belongs to the class ``0''), evaluates for many thresholds.
The AUC value lies between 0.5, denoting a bad classifier, and 1, denoting an excellent classifier.

\subsection{Class intervals for decision maker}\label{class-intervals-for-decision-maker}}

What can you say by looking at the map?
Actually a risk heat map is a data visualization tool for communicating the level for a specific risk to occur.
These maps helps authorities to identify and prioritize the risks associated with a given hazard.

Normally an authority (i.e., a decision maker) prioritize its efforts based on the available resources it has.
So, it can be more useful to detect the areas with the highest probability of burning based given intervals (i.e., breaks).
The authority can thus concentrate its resources for preventive actions on a given percentage (such as 5\%, 10\%, or 20\%) of the area with the highest probability of burning, instead of concentrate on the areas with a ``stochastic'' output probability value of 0.8 (for example).

Although machine learning algorithms are often considered as a black box, RF provides two metrics allowing to assess the importance of each variables in the model: the mean decrease in accuracy (MDA), and the mean decrease in Gini index.
The higher values indicate the most important variables.
In addition, it is possible to plot a sample tree (selected randomly) to analyse its structure.

In addition, the partial dependent plot allows to estimate, for each single variable, the relative probability of prediction success over different ranges of values.
It gives a graphical depiction of the marginal effect of each variable on the class probability over different ranges of continuous or discrete values.
Positive values are associated with the probability of occurrence of the phenomena (i.e., landslides presence), while negative vales indicate its absence.

\section{Conclusions and further analyses}\label{conclusions-and-further-analyses-3}}

This exercise allowed you to familiarize with Random Forest, by the proposed application about landslides susceptibility mapping and variables importance assessment.

To be sure that everything is perfectly clear for you, we propose you to \textbf{answer the following questions} and to discuss your answers with the other participants to the course or directly with the teacher.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  Why is it important to implement the pseudo-absence, other that the presences (i.e., the observations) in a data-driven modelization?
\item
  What is the difference between a numerical and a categorical variable?
  Give some examples of both types.
\item
  Which is the values of the OOB estimate error rate of your model?
  Which parameters you can change to try to reduce it?
  Be brave and do it (i.e., change the values for \emph{ntree} and \emph{mtry,} than analyse which values for the AUC you obtain and which model perform better.
\item
  Which are the three most important variables of your model (based on the MDA)?
\item
  What is the slope value (or range of values) that gives the highest probability of landslides occurrence?
  And for the geology, which are the most important classes?
\item
  In a model seeking to estimate the vulnerability to wildfire, which is the dependent variable and which can be the independent variables?
  The reading of the paper @tonini\_evolution\_2017, which inspired this lab, can help you in in this task.
