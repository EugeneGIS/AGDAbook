# Preface {.unnumbered}

Earth surface environmental processes exhibit distinctive characteristics, encompassing both spatial and temporal dimensions, along with various attributes and predictive variables.
Coupled with uncertainty and complexity issues, all this contribute to make this field of research highly challenging.
Furthermore, in the era of Data Science, the wealth of available data and the rapid development of analytical models have emerged as distinctive aspects in the realm of **Advanced Geospatial Data Analysis (AGDA)**.
The domain of AGDA encompasses data exploration, manipulation, and modelling, from the acquisition phase up to the visualization and interpretation of the results.
Mapping where events are located and how they relate to each other provides a better understanding of the process being studied.
Finally, as an increasing volume of geo-environmental data becomes more and more accessible, the demand for spatial data scientists is growing rapidly, both in public research institutions as well as in private companies.

The term "**Data Science**" was defined for the first time by Peter Naur in 1974 as "*the science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences*" [@naur_peter_concise_1974].
In essence, this definition frames Data Science as the technical and methodological handling of data, while the initial creation or gathering of data, as well as the interpretation of its meaning in the broader context, is not the primary focus of this discipline.
Later, in 1977, the International Association for Statistical Computing (IASC) further refined the concept of data science, emphasizing its role in the process of transforming raw data into valuable information and actionable knowledge.
The IASC articulated that data science involves not only the collection and processing of data but also the application of statistical methods and computational techniques to extract meaningful insights, which can then be used to support decision-making and drive innovation across various domains ([KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/11/data-science-history-overview.html))​.

These definitions and the evolution of the term highlight the progressive expansion of Data Science from a narrow focus on data handling to a broader interdisciplinary approach that combines statistics, computer science, and domain-specific knowledge to extract meaningful insights from data.

In disciplines like Environmental and Earth Sciences, Physical Geography, Humanities and Social Sciences, the use of Data Science procedures is emerging only recently, proving to be extremely efficient to deal with the complexity of the investigated process and the heterogeneity of the underlying data sources.
This leads to a cultural shift, moving scientists away from individual working within their own research domain.
Indeed, disciplinary boundaries are more and more permeable, pushing scientists to be more open to collaborate among them and with decision makers on the investigation and understanding of real-world problems.
Modern earth and environmental scientists need to interact with other disciplines, apparently far from their domain.
This openness is increasingly important as society struggles to respond to the implication of anthropogenic pressures on different issues, such as natural hazards and climate change, or the harmful impacts of human activities on biodiversity, water and air quality, human health.

## My Journey of Learning: Integrating Geospatial Data Analysis with Data Science

In the early 2000s, as I embarked on my PhD journey, a new frontier was beginning to unfold in the world of environmental research.
Geographical information systems (GIS) were just starting to make waves, offering a fresh perspective on how we could investigate and understand the environment.
It was through my thesis on the effects of spreading olive vegetation water on agricultural land that I first delved into the world of GIS.
Each tool and technique I learned opened new doors, revealing the vast potential of spatial data in environmental analysis and management.
This early exposure was more than just a technical skill; it was a revelation.
I began to see the world through the lens of spatial data, understanding how it could illuminate patterns and connections that were otherwise hidden.
This experience not only shaped my research but ignited a passion that would drive me to explore the depths of spatial analysis for years to come.

After completing my PhD, my journey led me to a PostDoc position where I had the extraordinary opportunity to work alongside Professor Mikhail Kanevski.
Mikhail was a true pioneer, a visionary in the fields of environmental data mining, geostatistics, and the burgeoning field of applying machine learning to spatial environmental data.
Being part of his research group was like stepping into a realm where the boundaries of what was possible were constantly being pushed and redefined.
In this research team, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of spatial statistics, driven by the desire to uncover valuable insights from the complex data that described our environment.
The work was challenging, yet it was also exhilarating, as every new technique I learned brought me closer to understanding the intricate tapestry of environmental phenomena.
This experience was pivotal, setting the course for my future research and solidifying my belief in the power of combining advanced techniques with a deep understanding of spatial data.

As the years passed, the tools and resources available to researchers like me grew exponentially.
The development and widespread adoption of free programming languages like Python and R revolutionized the way we approached statistical analysis and machine learning.
What was once the domain of a select few became accessible to many, thanks to the wealth of pre-developed scripts and resources these languages offered.
For me, and for countless others, this accessibility was a game-changer.
It meant that advanced techniques were no longer out of reach, and it fostered a culture of greater reproducibility in research.

Using standardized, widely adopted tools like Python and R, researchers could now more easily share their code and methodologies, allowing others to replicate and validate findings.
This collaborative spirit not only strengthened the reliability and credibility of scientific research but also created a community where knowledge could be shared and built upon more effectively.

Reflecting on this journey, I realize that each step—from my early days with GIS to my time in Professor Kanevski’s group, to my current role as an independent lead researcher in environmental spatial data analysis in the era of data science—has been a chapter in a larger story of discovery and innovation.
It’s a story of how spatial data and advanced analytics have become indispensable tools in our quest to understand and protect the environment, and it’s a story that continues to unfold with each new challenge and breakthrough.
